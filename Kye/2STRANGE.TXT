   Here are two strange Kye boards. (Or are they're TOO strange.  You
decide!)  They both require a trick that I have not seen in any other
Kye board (although, admittedly, there are still a number that I haven't 
tried yet).  Both can be done quickly and easily (once you know how, that 
is).  Using a mouse will not help, nor is it necessary to be capable of 
unusually quick keyboard action.
   The first board will prepare you for the second.  (So you Kye Wizards
out there who are looking for the biggest challenge should jump immediately 
to the second level, JUNKYARD DOGS, without first attempting or even looking
at the first level.)
   I'd appreciate knowing what you think of these.  Were they interesting?  
Hard or easy?  
   If you need more hints to do them, send me an email.  Have fun!
