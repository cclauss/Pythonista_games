'ASH' Levels for Kye 2

ashfasts.kye:

ADRIAN'S DIFFICULTY RATING:  6/10

In these four Kye 2 levels, speed and quick
thinking are a necessity.  I highly recommend
using the mouse for the last one-actually, it's
only possible when the mouse is in use, because
when the keyboard is used, the other things speed
up and when the mouse is used, the things don't.
Anyway, the four levels are:

PATHMAKER
QUICKNESS
BURN RUBBER
THE ULTIMATE

These four Kye 2 levels are entirely the opposite
of ashfasts.kye.  Each level in the file is
basically the Kye, the monsters, the diamonds, and
the yellow block things (earth??).  In these 'mazes',
as I have dubbed them, one must get the diamonds
without setting the monsters free.  If all of the
above made no sense to you at all, just skip this
text and play the game-you'll figure it out.
The levels are:

FIRST MAZE
BLOB MAZE
BOTTLE MAZE
TRICKY MAZE

These five Kye 2 levels all deal with clockers and
aclockers and the challenges that surround them.
I have dubbed these type of levels 'shows', because
very often a certain dazzling effect occurs when
you watch the rockies spin around and around.
Anyway, the levels are arranged by means of
talent, with the moderately easy levels first and
the harder/trickier ones later on.  The first
levels prepare you for the middle ones, which
prepare you for the last ones.  Interesting concept,
isn't it!
The levels are:

SHOW AUDITION
SHOW
SHOW SEQUEL
SOLO SHOW
BOUNCER SHOW

ADRIAN'S DIFFICULTY RATING:  8/10

These five levels all have to do with sliders and how
they can trap you if you don't get the diamonds in the
correct order.  My tip for these levels is to look at
the level before you play it, to see what will happen
if you set off certain traps.
The level's names are:

SLIDER FUN
MORE SLIDERS
SLIDER CHAOS
SLIDER CONTROL
SLIDER MAYHEM


Summary:
--------
All in all, I hope you enjoy these Kye 2 levels as
much as I enjoyed making them.  I highly welcome
any questions or comments on them and, if you would

Feel free to give these levels to anyone and
everyone you know that happens to have Kye 2.
Thanks, and enjoy!!
