This is a series of python word and board games to operate on the iPad using the Pythonista app.
A generic gui framework has been developed to place a grid at maximum size, along with buttons and messages
Games are:
Sudoko
Wordsearch
Scrabble
ZipWords
NumberWords
Anagram words
Wordle clone
Tetris
Demolition (my own from 1983!)
SeaBattle
Othello
Connect4
Minesweeper
Chess (WIP)
Kye

Much of the  working engines of these games were provided by other developers.
I have added the gui front end for use on ios using Pythonista, along with any changes I saw fit.
